NAME
    TBX::Checker - Check TBX validity using TBXChecker

VERSION
    version 0.03

SYNOPSIS
            use TBX::Checker qw(check);
            my ($passed, $messages) = check('/path/to/file.tbx');
            $passed && print 'ok!'
                    or print join (qq{\n}, @$messages);

DESCRIPTION
    This modules allows you to use the Java TBXChecker utility from Perl. It
    has one function, "check" which returns the errors found by the
    TBXChecker (hopefully none!).

METHODS
  "check"
    Checks the validity of the given TBX file. Returns 2 elements: a boolean
    representing the validity of the input TBX, and an array reference
    containing messages returned by TBXChecker.

    Arguments: a string containing a TBX file path, or a string pointer
    containing TBX data to be checked, followed by named arguments accepted
    by TBXChecker. For example: "check('file.tbx', loglevel =" 'ALL')>. The
    allowed parameters are listed below:

        loglevel      Increase level of output while processing.
                             OFF     => Error code only.
                             SEVERE  => Error code only.
                             WARNING => Valid or invalid message (default).
                             INFO    => Location of files used in processing.
                             CONFIG  => .
                             FINE    => .
                             FINER   => .
                             FINEST  => .
                             ALL     => All logging messages.
        lang           ISO-639 lowercase two-letter language code.
        country      ISO-3166 uppercase two-letter country code.
        variant
        system       System ID to use for relative paths in document.
                             Default: Uses the directory where the file is located.
        version       Displays version information and quits.
        environment    Adds the environmental conditions on startup to the messages.

    Keep in mind that if you use a string pointer instead of a file name,
    all relative URI's will be resolved from the current working directory.
